**Summary:** Documenting my learning process as I went from beginner to keen amateur in surf photography. Monetised with affiliate links, built on Wordpress.

Writing about what you're doing is a great way to reinforce what you're learning. 
Often the best person t learn something from is someone who is just a few steps ahead of yourself in the process.

I'd made a few WordPress websites in the past, and experimented with Tumblr as a platform for documenting the things I was experimenting with in surf photography.

In 2012 I decided to formalise my surf photography learning process by registering learningsurfphotography.com and setting up a WordPress site.

I didn't want to spend any money (I was saving up for a water housing for my camera at the time), so I used a free hosting provider for the nascent site.

About a year later I was hitting the limits of free hosting so I moved on to a shared hosting package. I learned about administering a WordPress site, juggling domain names and was beginning to think about monetising my site to cover the hosting costs.

I tried out Google AdSense, but I dislike adverts as much as everyone else, so I gave up after a few months.

At this point I was tapping in to podcasts as a source of information that I could gather when doing otherwise boring activities. I'm not sure where I heard about affiliate programmes first, but soon after I signed up for Amazon's affiliate system and started adding links to the reviews and list posts I was making on the site.

My wife and I had our first child in 2014, and in the downtime between parenting duties I would usually manage to write a blog post and a couple of Instagram posts a week to promote the site.

Since then it's helped tens of thousands of people improve their surf photography techniques and get the right equipment.

In Summer 2029 I launched the Learning Surf Photography video course, with three tiered levels.
